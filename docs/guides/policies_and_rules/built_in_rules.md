# The Built-in Rules

English | [简体中文](built_in_rules.zh_CN.md)

**vArmor** supports defining [VarmorPolicy](../../getting_started/usage_instructions.md#varmorpolicy) or [VarmorClusterPolicy](../../getting_started/usage_instructions.md#varmorclusterpolicy) objects using built-in rules in **EnhanceProtect** mode. The currently supported built-in rules and categories are shown in the following table. You can also try using the [policy advisor](../policy_advisor.md) to generate a policy template with built-in rules.

Note:<br />- The built-in rules supported by different enforcers are still under development.<br />- There are some limitations in the rules and syntax supported by different enforcers. For example, the AppArmor enforcer does not support fine-grained network access control, and BPF does not support access control for specified executables.<br />

Its core function is to precisely control the processing timing of page errors (Page Fault), creating a predictable vulnerability trigger window for attackers.<br /><br />Since Linux 5.11, the global variable sysctl_unprivileged_userfaultfd in kernel fs/userfaultfd.c is initialized to 0, and a userfaultfs object can be created only if the process has SYS_CAP_PTRACE permissions.<br /><br />This rule can be used to harden containers on systems where kernel.unprivileged_userfaultfd=1.

|**Attack Protection**|Mitigating Information Leakage|Mitigating ServiceAccount token leakage.<br /><br />`mitigate-sa-leak`|ALL|This rule prohibits container processes from reading sensitive Service Account-related information, including tokens, namespaces, and CA certificates. It helps prevent security risks arising from the leakage of Default ServiceAccount or misconfigured ServiceAccount. In the event that attackers gain access to a container through an RCE vulnerability, they often seek to further infiltrate by leaking ServiceAccount information.<br /><br />In most user scenarios, there is no need for Pods to communicate with the API Server using ServiceAccounts.
