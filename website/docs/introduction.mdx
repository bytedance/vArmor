# Introduction
Learn about vArmor and create your first policy through a Quick Start guide.

## About vArmor

vArmor is a cloud-native container sandbox system. It leverages Linux's [AppArmor LSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppArmor), [BPF LSM](https://docs.kernel.org/bpf/prog_lsm.html) and [Seccomp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seccomp) technologies to implement enforcers. It can be used to strengthen container isolation, reduce the kernel attack surface, and increase the difficulty and cost of container escape or lateral movement attacks. You can leverage vArmor in the following scenarios to provide sandbox protection for containers within a Kubernetes cluster.
* In multi-tenant environments, hardware-virtualized container solutions cannot be employed due to factors such as cost and technical conditions.
* When there is a need to enhance the security of critical business containers, making it more difficult for attackers to escalate privileges, escape, or laterally move.
* When high-risk vulnerabilities are present, but immediate remediation is not possible due to the difficulty or lengthy process of patching. vArmor can be used to mitigate the risks (depending on the vulnerability type or exploitation vector) to block or increase the difficulty of exploitation.

*Note: To meet stringent isolation requirements, it is advisable to give priority to utilizing hardware-virtualized containers (e.g., Kata Containers) for compute isolation, in conjunction with network isolation provided by CNI's NetworkPolicy.*

**vArmor Features:**
* Cloud-native. vArmor follows the Kubernetes Operator design pattern, allowing users to harden specific workloads by manipulating the [CRD API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/). This approach enables sandboxing of containerized microservices from a perspective closely aligned with business needs.
* Supports the use of AppArmor, BPF, Seccomp enforcer individually or in combination, enforcing mandatory access control on container file access, process execution, network outbound, syscall, and more.
* Supports the Allow-by-Default security model, in which only behaviors explicitly declared will be blocked, thus minimize performance impact and enhancing usability.
* Supports behavior modeling, and provides protection based on behavior models, meaning only behaviors explicitly declared are permitted.
* Ready to use out of the box. vArmor includes multiple built-in rules for direct use.

vArmor was created by the **Elkeid Team** of the endpoint security department at ByteDance. And the project is still in active development.


## How vArmor works

### Architecture
vArmor primarily consists of two components: the Manager and the Agent. The Manager is responsible for responding to and managing policy objects, while the Agent handles the management of enforcers and profiles on Nodes.

### Principle
* The [VarmorPolicy](getting_started/usage_instructions#varmorpolicy) and [VarmorClusterPolicy](getting_started/usage_instructions#varmorclusterpolicy) CRs serve as user interfaces.
* With VarmorPolicy or VarmorClusterPolicy objects, users can harden specific workloads and decide which enforcers and rules to use.
* The ArmorProfile CR acts as an internal interface used for profile management.

  alt="vArmor Principle" 
/>

When the Manager detects the creation event of a VarmorPolicy or VarmorClusterPolicy object, it generates a corresponding internal object called ArmorProfile. The Agent listens for and responds to this ArmorProfile object, processing the profiles and then reporting the status back to the Manager. When a user creates a workload, the APIServer sends the creation request to the Manager through the admission webhook. The Manager evaluates whether the workload should be hardened. If so, the Manager mutates the workload by adding annotations and modifying the securityContext. Finally, the workload's Pod will be scheduled to a Node, and the security context will be set when the container is created.

### Key Terms
#### The Enforcer
vArmor abstracts AppArmor, BPF, and Seccomp as enforcers. The policy can use them individually or in combination to harden workloads, such as: AppArmorBPF, AppArmorSeccomp, AppArmorBPFSeccomp etc.

You can specify the enforcer through the `spec.policy.enforcer` field of [VarmorPolicy](getting_started/usage_instructions#varmorpolicy) or [VarmorClusterPolicy](getting_started/usage_instructions#varmorclusterpolicy) objects. 

#### The Policy Mode
The vArmor policy can operate in five modes: *AlwaysAllow, RuntimeDefault, EnhanceProtect, BehaviorModeling and DefenseInDepth*. This flexibility allows it to meet the needs of different scenarios.

For more information, please refer to the [Policy Modes](./guides/policies_and_rules/policy_modes).

#### The Built-in and Custom Rule
When the policy is running in **EnhanceProtect** mode, [Built-in Rules](./guides/policies_and_rules/built_in_rules) and [Custom Rules](./guides/policies_and_rules/custom_rules) can be used to harden the container. The policy operates with the **Allow-by-Default** security model, meaning only behaviors explicitly declared will be blocked. This approach minimizes performance impact while enhancing usability.

## Quick Start
### Step 1. Fetch chart
```
helm pull oci://elkeid-ap-southeast-1.cr.volces.com/varmor/varmor --version 0.5.11
```

### Step 2. Install
The default configuration enables the AppArmor and Seccomp enforcers. Please refer to the documentation for more [configuration options](getting_started/installation#configuration).

```
helm install varmor varmor-0.5.11.tgz \
    --namespace varmor --create-namespace \
    --set image.registry="elkeid-ap-southeast-1.cr.volces.com"
```
*You can use the domain `elkeid-cn-beijing.cr.volces.com` inside of the CN region.*

### Step 3. Try with this example
Create demo namespace.
```
kubectl create namespace demo
```
Create a VarmorPolicy object to enable the **AlwaysAllow mode** for `deployments` that match the `spec.target.selector`.
```
cat << EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: crd.varmor.org/v1beta1
kind: VarmorPolicy
metadata:
  name: demo-1
  namespace: demo
spec:
  target:
    kind: Deployment
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: demo-1
  policy:
    enforcer: AppArmor
    mode: AlwaysAllow
EOF
```
View the status of VarmorPolicy & ArmorProfile object.
```
kubectl get VarmorPolicy -n demo
kubectl get ArmorProfile -n demo
```
Create the target Deployment object.
```
cat << EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: demo-1
  namespace: demo
  labels:
    sandbox.varmor.org/enable: "true"
    app: demo-1
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: demo-1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: demo-1
      annotations:
        # Use this annotation to explicitly disable the protection for the container named c0.
        # It always takes precedence over the '.spec.target.containers' field.
        container.apparmor.security.beta.varmor.org/c0: unconfined
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: c0
        image: debian:10
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "sleep infinity"]
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
      - name: c1
        image: debian:10
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "sleep infinity"]
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent

EOF
```
Retrieve the Pod name of the target Deployment object.
```
POD_NAME=$(kubectl get Pods -n demo -l app=demo-1 -o name)
```
Execute a command in container `c1` to read the SA token.
```
kubectl exec -n demo $POD_NAME -c c1 -- cat /run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token
```
Switch the VarmorPolicy object to **EnhancedProtect mode** to prohibit the container `c1` from reading the secret token.
```
cat << EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: crd.varmor.org/v1beta1
kind: VarmorPolicy
metadata:
  name: demo-1
  namespace: demo
spec:
  target:
    kind: Deployment
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: demo-1
  policy:
    enforcer: AppArmor
    mode: EnhanceProtect
    enhanceProtect:
      hardeningRules:
      - disable-cap-privileged
      attackProtectionRules:
      - rules:
        - mitigate-sa-leak
EOF
```
Execute a command in container `c1` to read the SA token and verify that the reading behavior is prohibited.
```
kubectl exec -n demo $POD_NAME -c c1 -- cat /run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token
```
