# The Built-in Rules

**vArmor** supports defining [VarmorPolicy](../../getting_started/usage_instructions#varmorpolicy) or [VarmorClusterPolicy](../../getting_started/usage_instructions#varmorclusterpolicy) objects using built-in rules in **EnhanceProtect mode**. The currently supported built-in rules and categories are shown in the following table. You can also try using the [policy advisor](https://github.com/bytedance/varmor/tools/policy-advisor/tree/main/README.md) to generate a policy template with built-in rules.

Note:<br />- The built-in rules supported by different enforcers are still under development.<br />- There are some limitations in the rules and syntax supported by different enforcers. For example, the AppArmor enforcer does not support fine-grained network access control, and BPF does not support access control for specified executables.<br />

|**Attack Protection**|Mitigating Information Leakage|Mitigating ServiceAccount token leakage.<br /><br />`mitigate-sa-leak`|ALL|This rule prohibits container processes from reading sensitive Service Account-related information, including tokens, namespaces, and CA certificates. It helps prevent security risks arising from the leakage of Default ServiceAccount or misconfigured ServiceAccount. In the event that attackers gain access to a container through an RCE vulnerability, they often seek to further infiltrate by leaking ServiceAccount information.<br /><br />In most user scenarios, there is no need for Pods to communicate with the API Server using ServiceAccounts.

This also provides attackers with a lot of convenience, as they can use busybox to execute commands and assist in their attacks.|Prohibit the execution of busybox.<br /><br />If containerized services rely on busybox or related bash commands, enabling this policy may lead to runtime errors.|AppArmor<br />BPF
|                 |              |Prohibit the creation of Unix shells<br /><br />`disable-shell`|ALL|After gaining remote code execution privileges through an RCE vulnerability, attackers may use a reverse shell to gain arbitrary command execution capabilities within the container.<br /><br />This rule prohibits container processes from creating new Unix shells, thus defending against reverse shell.|Prohibit the creation of Unix shells<br /><br />Some base images may symlink sh to /bin/busybox. In this scenario, it's also necessary to prohibit the execution of busybox.|AppArmor<br />BPF

|                 |              |Prohibit the execution of chmod command<br /><br />`disable-chmod`|ALL|When attackers gain control over a container through vulnerabilities, they typically attempt to download additional attack code or tools into the container for further attacks, such as privilege escalation, lateral movement, cryptocurrency mining, and more. In this attack chain, attackers often use the chmod command to modify file permissions for execution.|Prohibit the execution of chmod command.<br /><br />Some base images may symlink wget to /bin/busybox.

In this scenario, it's also necessary to prohibit the execution of busybox command.|AppArmor<br />BPF
|                 |Restrict Specific Executable|-|ALL|This rule extends the use cases of 'Mitigating Information Leakage' and 'Disabling Sensitive Operations', it allows user to apply restrictions only to specific executable programs within containers.<br /><br />Restricting specified executable programs serves two purposes:<br />1). Preventing sandbox policies from affecting the execution of application services within containers.<br />2).Restricting specified executable programs within containers increases the cost and difficulty for attackers<br /><br />For example, this feature can be used to restrict programs like busybox, bash, sh, curl within containers, preventing attackers from using them to execute sensitive operations. Meanwhile, the application services is unaffected by sandbox policies and can continue to access ServiceAccount tokens and perform other tasks normally.<br /><br />*Note: Due to the implementation principles of BPF LSM, this feature cannot be provided by the BPF enforcer.*|Enable sandbox restrictions for specified executable programs.|AppArmor
